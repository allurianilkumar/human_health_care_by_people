             The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) is a 
             not-for-profit organization dedicated to improving healthcare quality,
             safety, cost-effectiveness, and access, through the best use of information technology and management systems.
             Originally founded in 1961 as the Hospital Management Systems Society,
             it is now headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.
          </p>
          <p>
             The society includes more than 50,000 individual members,
             over 570 corporate members,
             and more than 225 not-for-profit organizations.

              (May 2015) Along with the Radiological Society of North America,
              HIMSS is a sponsor of the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) initiative.
              HIMSS is also home to the Electronic Health Records Association.

              Supported by both the American Medical Informatics Association and HIMSS,
               the Alliance for Nursing Informatics represents more than 2,000 nurses and
               brings together 18 distinct nursing informatics groups that function independently.

          <p>Health informatics (also called health care informatics,
           healthcare informatics, medical informatics, nursing informatics,
            clinical informatics, or biomedical informatics) is informatics in health care.
             It is a multidisciplinary field that uses health information technology (HIT) 
             to improve health care via any combination of higher quality, higher efficiency 
             purring lower cost and thus greater availability), and new opportunities.
              </p><p>
              The NLM defines health informatics as "the interdisciplinary study of the design,
              evelopment, adoption and application of IT-based innovations in healthcare 
              services delivery, management and planning."[1] It deals with the resources, 
              devices, and methods required to optimize the acquisition, storage, retrieval, 
              and use of information in health and biomedicine. Health informatics tools 
              include amongst others computers, clinical guidelines, formal medical 
              terminologies, and information and communication systems.[2][3] It is
               applied to the areas of nursing, clinical care, dentistry, pharmacy, 
               public health, occupational therapy, physical therapy and (bio)medical 
               research, and alternative medicine.

            ICS 35.240.80[6] in which ISO 27799:2008 is one of the core 
            components.[7]
                Molecular bioinformatics and clinical informatics have 
                converged into the field of translational bioinformatics.</p>
